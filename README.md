### Idea Summary

This project utilizes the Heltec LoRa development board with a GPS module<sup>1</sup> to develop a smart parking system for cities, driven by the need to address parking scarcity in busy areas. The increasing adoption of smart parking systems is expected in the near future<sup>2</sup>. In an ideal world, this approach would enable users to exchange information on parking spot availability through the MQTT network protocol (TCP/IP under the hood), resulting in reduced driving time and decreased accident risks. In our use case, the MQTT paradigm comprises of a Broker, Device Under Test (DUT), and Inspector, where the Broker serves as the access point, the DUT stores the data, and the Inspector manages button presses and input coordinates.

### Idea Summary

This project utilizes the Heltec LoRa development board with a GPS module<sup>1</sup> to develop a smart parking system for cities, driven by the need to address parking scarcity in busy areas. The increasing adoption of smart parking systems is expected in the near future<sup>2</sup>. The system enables users to exchange information on parking spot availability through the MQTT network protocol, resulting in reduced driving time and decreased accident risks. It comprises a Broker, Device Under Test (DUT), and Inspector, with the Broker serving as the access point, the DUT storing data, and the Inspector managing button inputs and coordinates.
